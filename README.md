# A review of the voxelmorph and mermaid libraries for medical image registration

This repository shows the work done in a Seminar in FS 2021 at ETH ZÃ¼rich under the supervision of Professor Ender Konukoglu.
Two popular learning-based medical image registration frameworks ([voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph)
and [mermaid](https://github.com/uncbiag/registration)) were reviewed. Further, [voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph)
was trained on intra-modal and inter-modal MR brain images and the corresponding registration performances were evaluated.

## [Report](report.pdf)

This is the final report that summarizes the two frameworks and analysis the results from the experiments

## Usage of the code

The usage of the code can be found in the directory [registration](registration/README.md)
