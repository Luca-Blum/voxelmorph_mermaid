# A review of the voxelmorph and mermaid libraries for medical image registration

This repository shows the work done in a Seminar in FS 2021 at ETH ZÃ¼rich under the supervision of Professor Ender 
Konukoglu. Two popular learning-based medical image registration frameworks 
([voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) and 
[mermaid](https://github.com/uncbiag/registration)) were reviewed. Further, 
[voxelmorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) was trained on intra-modal and inter-modal MR brain images 
and the corresponding registration performances were evaluated.

## [Report](report.pdf)

This is the final report that summarizes the two frameworks and analyses the results from the experiments.

## [Presentation](presentation.pdf)

The report summarized the result from the papers without showing the corresponding figures, because it would be 
mostly copy-paste and would have stretched the report unnaturally. To get a visual insight to the results, some 
selected figures were added to the presentation. Additionally, some plots from my own experiments are included. This 
were not the final results because after the presentation the networks were trained further. The final results are 
presented in the [report](report.pdf)

## Usage of the code

The code and the usage of it can be found in the directory [registration](registration/README.md)
